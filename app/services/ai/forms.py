- name: as written (Thai or English).
- ot_from / ot_to: 24-hour HH:MM. "18.00" means 18:00. Leave null if not written.
- hours: the OT hours written on the form as a number (1.5 for 1 hour 30 minutes). Null if blank.
- job: the job or task written for the row, if any.
- signed: true if the employee's signature box has a signature.
- work_date: YYYY-MM-DD. Thai Buddhist years (2569) must be converted to Gregorian (2026).
